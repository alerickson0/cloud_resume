# Cloud Resume Challenge

Repository for my resume created for the Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS edition). Currently, you can find my resume site at [alvaro-erickson-resume.com](https://alvaro-erickson-resume.com/) or [www.alvaro-erickson-resume.com](https://www.alvaro-erickson-resume.com/).

## Work in progress

The repository is still a work in progress. I am working on items like:

1. Linting - Initial linting setup, need to configure it
2. Auto update of Terraform changes - Need to setup GitHub Action workflow to update my infrastructure any time the Terraform code is updated
