# Cloud Resume Challenge

Repository for my resume created for the [Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS edition)](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/). Currently, you can find my resume site at [alvaro-erickson-resume.com](https://alvaro-erickson-resume.com/) or [www.alvaro-erickson-resume.com](https://www.alvaro-erickson-resume.com/).

## Work in progress

The repository is still a work in progress. I am working on items like:

1. CI/CD To update the Terraform/IaC changes - Need to setup GitHub Actions workflow to update my infrastructure any time the Terraform code is updated
2. CI/CD for the frontend - Need to setup GitHub GitHub Actions workflow for any time any of the frontend code is updated (e.g., resume HTML, CSS file)
