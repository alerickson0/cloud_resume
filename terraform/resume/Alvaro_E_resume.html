  <h4>Merit International, Remote - 2/2022 – 2/2024</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Senior Software Engineer / Infrastructure</b><br>
    At Merit, I focused on the Build &amp; Release work for the Infrastructure team. This included work to create infrastructure in GCP 
    via Terraform. And automate this work via CI/CD pipelines.<br>
    <em>Notable Projects:</em><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Build:</b> Did such things as creating reusable GitHub Actions to be used by various teams and projects to institute CI/CD. Also, advised teams on CI/CD best practices. To help automate the CD, implemented Conventional Commits to automate code merges. In addition, for CD, implemented Semantic Release to automate the build and tagging of applications and releases. Wrote and presented ADR’s for major software implementations at the company.</li>
      <li><b>Release Engineer:</b> Created the release process to ensure smooth releases. Scheduled standard and emergency releases to production. Documented detailed steps of the release process for others to follow. Also, scheduled separate infrastructure specific maintenance windows. For infrastructure maintenance windows, gathered the updates (e.g., vendor software updates) that needed to be deployed. For all types of releases and windows, deployed the updates to various platforms like Kubernetes clusters.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Norpro, Inc., Everett, WA - 10/2019 – 2/2021</h4>
  <p>
    <b>DevOps / IT</b><br>
    At Norpro, Inc., I worked in Ops where I did various projects, created and maintained company websites. Also, performed various IT duties.<br>
    <em>Notable Projects:</em><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Consumer and Wholesale sites - Ops:</b> Setup a new ecommerce Consumer site built and setup on a combination of the following technologies: CentOS, Magento, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Also, maintained and administered the Wholesale site by doing things like ensuring it was to update.</li>
      <li><b>IT projects:</b> Created Python programs to do data migrations from IBM Mainframe to SQL Server. Setup a local Git server to house local code projects. Created a new sales report using a combination of Excel and SQL Server scripts and stored procedures. Helped co-workers with various IT issues like setting up computers, troubleshooting computer issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h4>VisionGate, Inc., Woodinville, WA - 10/2017 – 6/2019</h4>
  <p>
    <b>DevOps / IT</b><br>
    At VisionGate, Inc., I had two roles: DevOps (my main role) and IT. As DevOps, I created build environments and process where there were none. Also, investigated ways to automate installs and creation of infrastructure.<br>
    <em>Notable Projects:</em><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Biotechnology startup - DevOps:</b> In this role, I was tasked with creating build environments (using VMware, CentOS/Ubuntu, Jenkins) for the consistent creation of software for the Cell-CT. In addition, I would document the process of release and installation of the created 
        software. Another task was to guide the software through the release process in the documentation control system (Arena). Once the software was approved for released, I then installed the software onto the Cell-CT. Another task in this official role was to modify any Cell-CT settings and document these modifications in Arena. Additionally, I would investigate ways to automate the installation of the software (e.g., Bash shell scripts, Python programs) that is currently a manual process. For infrastructure automation, I researched and implemented using Packer to create Virtual Machines to create different environments.</li>
      <li><b>Biotechnology startup - IT:</b> In this role, I supported my VisionGate colleagues, IT infrastructure, and worked on IT projects. To support my colleagues, this included: Helping with printer problems; Server and application upgrades; Virus and malware issues; Server and application issues; Setting up new work laptops. To support IT infrastructure, this included: Troubleshooting server issues; Troubleshooting internet and networking issues. For IT projects, this included: Setting up and configuring new and old servers; Verifying we could restore our code repository from backup; Improving backups (e.g., code 
        repository); Major company-wide application upgrades; Installing new hardware; Setting up dedicated Ethernet lines for data intensive traffic.</li>
    </ul>
